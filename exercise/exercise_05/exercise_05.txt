Exercise 5: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

Problem:

Use an IIFE to create a module called `counterModule` that encapsulates a 
private variable 'count'. 

Expose methods `increment`, `decrement`, and `getValue` to 
manipulate and retrieve the value of 'count'. 

Demonstrate that 'count' is not accessible from the global scope.
