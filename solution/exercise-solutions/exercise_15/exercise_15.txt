Exercise 15: Using bind(), call(), and apply()

Problem:

Write a function `greet` that accepts a 'greeting' message and logs it 
along with the person's 'name' (this.name). 

Create an object `user` with a 'name' property. 

Use the Function prototype methods call(), apply(), and bind() 
from the `greet` function to invoke `greet` with `user` as `this` 
and explain the differences.
