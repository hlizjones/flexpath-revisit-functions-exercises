Exercise 2: Arrow Functions and 'this' Binding

Problem:

Create an object `calculator` with a property 'currentValue' and two methods: 
one using a traditional function and another using an arrow function. 

Both methods increment 'currentValue' by 1. 

Demonstrate how the keyword `this` behaves differently in both methods.
